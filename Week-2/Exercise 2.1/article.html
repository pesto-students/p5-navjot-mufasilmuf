                        The Asian Cricket Council Asia Cup is a men's One Day International and Twenty20 International
                        cricket tournament.
                        It was established in 1983 when the Asian Cricket Council was founded as a measure to promote
                        goodwill between
                        Asian countries. It was originally scheduled to be held every two years. The Asia Cup is the
                        only
                        continental
                        championship in cricket and the winning team becomes the champions of Asia. It alternates every
                        2-years between ODI
                        and T20I formats.

                        The first Asia cup was held in 1984 in Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates where the council's
                        offices were based
                        (until 1995). India boycotted the 1986 tournament due to strained cricketing relations with Sri
                        Lanka. Pakistan
                        boycotted the 1990â€“91 tournament due to strained political relations with India and the 1993
                        tournament was cancelled
                        for the same reason. The ACC announced that the tournament would be held biennially from 2009
                        onwards.[3] The ICC has
                        ruled that all games played in the Asia Cup have official ODI status.

                        After downsizing the Asian Cricket Council in 2015, it was announced by the ICC that Asia Cup
                        events
                        from 2016 would be played on a rotation basis between One Day International and Twenty20
                        International format, on the basis of the format of upcoming world events.[4] As a result, the
                        2016
                        event was the first event played in the T20I format and functioned as a preparatory tournament
                        ahead
                        of the 2016 ICC World Twenty20.

                        India, with seven titles (six ODI and one T20I), is the most successful team in the tournament.
                        Sri
                        Lanka is the second most successful team, with five. Sri Lanka has played the most Asia Cups
                        (14)
                        followed by India, Pakistan and Bangladesh who have played 13 each.

                        The first edition of the Rothmans Asia Cup was held in 1984[5][6][7][8] in Sharjah, UAE, the
                        location of the headquarters of the newly formed Asian Cricket Council. The tournament was a
                        round-robin tournament among India, Sri Lanka and Pakistan. The first match was between Pakistan
                        and
                        the new ICC member Sri Lanka. India won this tournament with two victories, Sri Lanka were the
                        runners up in the tournament with a single victory over Pakistan, while Pakistan went home
                        without
                        winning any of its two games.
